# Toolbox

A collection of lightweight browser apps served from a single landing page. Each mini-app focuses on quick interactions, from shuffling curated decks to formatting lists for development workflows.

## Available apps

- **Random Jokes** – Shuffle developer-friendly jokes, reveal punchlines on demand, and jump to the full archive when you need more context.
- **Proverbs** – Cycle through a constantly shuffled proverb deck with keyboard support and access to the complete listing.
- **Value Formatter** – Turn newline-separated entries into formatted key-value pairs for quick copy/paste in code reviews or data preparation.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern browser to launch the landing page, then choose the tool you need. Every app runs entirely on the client, so no build step or backend setup is required.

## Local development

Because the site is static, you can use any local web server for live reloads while editing files. For example, from the repository root:

```bash
npx serve .
```

This starts a server on <http://localhost:3000> (or the next available port).
